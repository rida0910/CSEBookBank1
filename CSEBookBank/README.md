# CSEBookBank
Library management system in asp.net mvc
Book Bank - our project is a web application designed for the library of department of “Computer Science and Engineering”. 
This will be a library for all students of computer sciences and engineering. Library is a store house of books and with the 
increase in members it is difficult for the librarian to keep the record manually and to maintain it well. So, we are devising a
system through which librarians stress will be calmed. And students will get the easier access towards the books. 
The library will be open 24/7 so students won’t have to check the library hours for the sake of study. Even all lax students will
get the benefit from this library a night before exam. It will also eliminate the problem of travelling and expenses. 
Librarian will be able to keep the record of students in a much better and easier way. All students and librarian will be 
able to check their activity. The system will remind the students of book returning before the predetermined date. 
The book stock of library will be gathered from the senior students who won’t need their books any more. Librarian will 
have an account and all admin rights will be given to him. He will be able to check the activity all over the library in a much 
better way. Any ambiguity will be detected efficiently. He will issue the books to the students and will notify them to return the 
books. The goal is to create an online library for the department. That will have the stock for all students of the department. 
Future work includes the growth of this system up to university level.
